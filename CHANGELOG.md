# Changelog

Versioned `YY.WW.D` — `date +%y.%V.%u` — year / ISO week / ISO weekday. One section per day; all of a day's commits collapse into one block. Trim to ≤ 200 lines; git keeps the rest.

## 26.41.5 — 2026-10-09

### Fixed
- `docker.md` — `.dockerignore` excludes env files at every depth (`**/.env`, `**/.env.*`, keeping `*.example`). Before, a local build with `deploy/.env.prod` present copied its credentials into the image.
- `docker.md` — container workers get `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` from the service `environment:`, not `.env`. Celery's `setdefault` to production settings runs before `base.py` reads `.env`, so workers ignored the local override.
- `ci.md` — `check --deploy` runs only when the security step was applied; without it the check fails with `security.W004/W008/W011/W016`.
- `dev-tools.md` — `django_migration_linter` registers without a `DEBUG` gate, and the CI step selects the local settings module. Before, CI (`DJANGO_DEBUG=False`) failed with `Unknown command: 'lintmigrations'`.

### Testcases and harness
- Harness pins move to `claude-sonnet-5-5` (build, baseline), `claude-opus-5-5` (review, scorecard) and `gemini-3.8-flash` (`agy`). `model_slug()` handles two-part version suffixes.

## 26.34.4 — 2026-08-22

### Changed
- Replace `django-csp` with Django 6.1's built-in CSP middleware and settings. GA4 now uses the core nonce context variable; generated CSP remains production-only and starts in report-only mode.
- `tasks-celery.md` — task examples pass serializable IDs, validate their targets, tolerate duplicate delivery, and retry only transient external failures.

### Testcases
- Cases 07–09 assert the core CSP contract in their shared boot checks, so the skill and baseline arms can be compared on the same requirement.

## 26.34.2 — 2026-08-17

### Changed
- Remove the standalone Django Tasks backport and DB/RQ adapters. Use core `django.tasks`; keep Celery as the worker-queue option and use `django-crontask` with the core API for periodic work.
- Remove remaining deprecated email configuration, patch pins, and drifting Django documentation links.

## 26.34.1 — 2026-08-17

### Changed
- Target Django 6.1. `email.md` migrates generated settings from deprecated `EMAIL_*` / `env.email_url()` configuration to `MAILERS`, including SMTP, Anymail, Mailpit, named mailers, and connection API replacements. New-project test settings and evaluation fixtures follow the same contract.

## 26.31.4 — 2026-07-30

### Added
- `docker.md` — a "Git worktrees" section, plus `${POSTGRES_PORT:-5432}`, `${REDIS_PORT:-6379}` and the two `${MAILPIT_*_PORT}` host-port variables in `docker.md` / `redis.md` / `email.md`. A worktree sets `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME` and an offset port in its own `.env` and gets its own containers, network and volume; without that, the pinned `name:` makes every worktree share one Postgres and one `pgdata`.
- Dev loop is now a foundation question (`SKILL.md` §2.6, default unchanged): `manage.py` on the host via `uv run`, or in a `web` container via `docker compose`. `docker.md` gains a "Django in the container" section — a `dev` Dockerfile target that keeps the venv at `/opt/venv` outside the bind mount, a `web` service whose healthcheck opens a socket (the slim image has neither curl nor wget), and `db` publishing no host port at all. The container loop needs one published port, so a worktree offsets `WEB_PORT` and nothing else.
- `dev-tasks.md` — container-loop task bodies: `uv run <cmd>` becomes `docker compose exec -T web <cmd>`, `install` builds the image, `dev` is `docker compose up`, and the `worker` / `tailwind` tasks go away because those are sibling services. `-T` on every scripted task, omitted for `shell` and `createsuperuser`, which need the TTY. Long-running add-ons point at the sibling-service snippet instead of describing it twice: `tasks-celery.md`, `tasks-django-db.md`, `tasks-django-rq.md`, `tailwind.md`.
- `i18n.md` — the `dev` stage needs the same `gettext` install the production builder carries. `manage.py compilemessages` checks for `msgfmt` before it looks for `.po` files, so on the slim image it fails outright.

### Testcases and harness
- Case 03 flips to the container dev loop — `web` + `worker` + `beat` + `db` + `redis`, only `web` publishing a port, every command through `docker compose exec -T web`. It asserts what host-loop cases cannot: that `db` and `redis` publish nothing, that the justfile drives the container, that `worker` and `beat` are still running rather than crash-looped behind a healthy `web`, and that `compilemessages` works (i18n=yes on a slim base is where the missing `gettext` shows up). Cases 04, 08 and 09 keep the host loop.
- Case 03 states its cache backend (`redis`) — the first case to cover that value, and the reason its `django-redis` assertion had been failing: cache is a separate §5.1 question, so a prompt that only asks for "redis (for Celery)" correctly yields no `CACHES` block. It also asserts the `- /app/.venv` mask, in the boot check and in the review. First run: 8/8, 538s, 101 tool calls, 0 fixes.

### Fixed
- `docker.md` — every service that bind-mounts `.:/app` also carries a `- /app/.venv` anonymous volume. `.dockerignore` governs the build context, not mounts, so the host venv `uv add` creates was reaching the container: a tree walk from `/app` saw 1226 `.po` files instead of the project's own, and `manage.py compilemessages` recompiled Django's shipped catalogs for every contrib app and wrote the `.mo` files back onto the host through the mount. Surfaced by the first case-03 container-loop run.

### Changed
- `error-reporting.md` — self-hosted GlitchTip gets its own `glitchtip-redis` service instead of db `/5` on the app's Redis, and `conventions.md` drops that row from the map. Redis db numbers namespace keys inside one application; GlitchTip is a separate application, and its Celery keys carry no TTL, so under the app's `--maxmemory-policy volatile-lru` a GlitchTip ingest backlog was unevictable and evicted the app's own cache to make room.

## 26.31.3 — 2026-07-29

### Added
- `pre-commit.md` — four hooks: `uv-lock` (blocks a commit whose `uv.lock` no longer matches `pyproject.toml`, which CI's `uv sync --locked` would reject), `django-upgrade` and `djade` (deprecated Django APIs and template syntax, neither covered by Ruff's `UP` ruleset), and `djhtml` (template indentation).
- `tailwind.md` — an optional `rustywind` pre-commit hook that sorts `class="…"` attributes into Tailwind's canonical order.

### Testcases and harness
- Case 02 flips to `Pre-commit hooks: yes` and both 02 and 07 now execute `pre-commit run` in their boot checks. Nothing in the suite had ever run a hook — the one case that enabled pre-commit only asserted the config file existed, which cannot catch a stale `rev:`, a renamed hook id, or generated templates that fail the skill's own formatters. 02 carries the template surface (`djhtml` / `djade` / `rustywind`), 07 covers the no-template path.

## 26.31.2 — 2026-07-28

### Changed
- The skill is now `django-seedkit` — invoke it as `/django-seedkit`. `skills/seedkit/` moved to `skills/django-seedkit/`, and the harness symlinks, testcase prompts and demo tape follow. The repo, the marketplace and the plugin keep the name `seedkit`, so `/plugin install seedkit@viewflow` and `npx skills add viewflow/seedkit` are unchanged and existing installs keep working.
- `deploy-vps.md` and `ci.md` spell out the SQLite variant of their Postgres-shaped samples — which compose services and volumes to swap, and that the CI service container goes away — so a SQLite + Litestream project doesn't have to infer them.

### Fixed
- `deploy-vps.md` — `.env.prod.example` adds `web` to `DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS`. Caddy's active health check dials the upstream directly and sends `Host: web:8000`, so Django answered 400, Caddy flagged the only upstream down, and every production request got a 502.
- `docker.md` — a pitfall for a bookworm runtime against `postgres:17`: bookworm's apt carries only the major-15 client and `pg_dump` aborts on a version mismatch. The bullet ships the PGDG repo snippet that installs `postgresql-client-17`.
- `tasks-django.md` — shows the `TaskResultStatus` members, so a task smoke test asserts `SUCCESSFUL` rather than a guessed name.
- `dev-tools.md` — django-orbit installs as `django-orbit[mcp]`, and the MCP server config is a project-root `.mcp.json` instead of a snippet for one developer's Claude Desktop file. Asking for orbit "with MCP" produced a project with no MCP surface at all: the agent took the plain install line, and the config it was pointed at lives outside the scaffold.
- `dev-tools.md` — django-migration-linter's exclusion list uses real app labels (`django_tasks_database`, `account`, `socialaccount`); the old sample carried package names that the linter ignores silently, so a `django-tasks-db` project had 10 upstream migrations flagged as errors. The section now shows how to read the labels off the running project.
- `dev-tools.md` — the django-zeal docs link pointed at a repository that no longer exists (`PedroBern/django-zeal`, 404); it is `taobojlen/django-zeal`.
- `auth.md` — the `django-mail-auth` EmailUser route registers a local `MailAuthUserConfig` pinning `default_auto_field` to `AutoField`. The package's own `AppConfig` leaves it unset, so it picked up the project's `BigAutoField`, and every `migrate` warned about unapplied changes while `makemigrations` wrote a migration into `.venv/` and CI's `makemigrations --check` failed.
- `dev-tools.md` — the `django-browser-reload` URL include is gated on `"django_browser_reload" in settings.INSTALLED_APPS` instead of `settings.DEBUG`. The Dockerfile's collectstatic step runs production settings with `DJANGO_DEBUG=True`, where the dev-only package isn't installed, so the old guard broke the image build with `ModuleNotFoundError`.
- `rest-modern-rest.md` — the install line now pins `django-modern-rest==0.11.0` and adds `pyjwt[crypto]`. 0.11.0's throttling module imports `jwt` unconditionally, so `manage.py check` died with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'jwt'` on a project that never asked for JWT auth.
- `django-tasks-db` / `django-tasks-rq` projects wrote the stdlib `django.tasks.backends.immediate.ImmediateBackend` into `test.py`; both backends are built on the `django_tasks` backport and need that import path. Both references also install `django-tasks` directly now, since `django_tasks` is registered in `INSTALLED_APPS`.
- `SKILL.md` — the post-`startapp` cleanup ran only `ruff check --fix`, which leaves the blank line the deleted stub import sat on, and `ruff check` reports those files clean. It now runs the formatter after and verifies with `ruff format --check`.
- `review-logs.sh` refused to start on a standalone clone. Its parent-pointer precondition read `diff-index`'s exit 128 ("not a git repository") as pointer drift, so the only way past it was to stash work that didn't exist. It now tests for a repo first and, when there isn't one, tells the reviewer to skip the parent-bump step instead of leaving it to hit the error mid-run.
- `review-logs.sh` archives each reviewed log to `logs/reviewed/` instead of deleting it, and only on a clean exit — a failed review keeps its log for the retry. `logs/` is gitignored, so the `rm` was destroying the only record of how a published result was produced.
- `csp.md` / `analytics.md` — a nonced inline script needs the `NONCE` sentinel in the `script-src` tuple, not just `nonce="{{ request.csp_nonce }}"` in the template. django-csp 4.0 dropped the implicit injection, so the GA4 `gtag('config', ...)` block rendered a live nonce against a header that carried none and the browser refused it — analytics never fired in production.
- `storage-s3.md` — the Fly `release_command` that chains `migrate` and `collectstatic` wraps them in `sh -c`. The release machine execs the argv directly, so a bare `&&` reached `manage.py migrate` as an app label and failed the deploy.
- `review-logs.sh`'s defect checklist runs `ruff check` and `ruff format --check` when the project configured Ruff. Every other item is a grep, and a grep cannot see formatting — `04-media-vault` shipped 8 unformatted files while scoring 8/8. The prompt also points the reviewer at the log's closing `FIXES` block first, where the build agent names in its own words each reference it had to work around.

### Testcases and harness
- `train/run-reproduce.sh` — a third grading phase, arm-neutral: hand a fresh agent a `git archive` of a published project and ask it to get that project running from the README alone. Every existing grader decides by reading files, and structure is what the skill is reliably best at, so both sit at their maximum — 8/8 in every scored case, and the per-case `## Review` has never flagged an issue across 17 logs. This asks what neither can: whether the artefact works for someone who wasn't there when it was built. Reports `REPRODUCE PASS|FAIL|BLOCKED` plus one `GAP` line per thing the README should have said, into `reproduce-<cli>.tsv`.

## 26.31.1 — 2026-07-27

### Fixed
- `lint.md` — the post-install normalize ran `ruff format` before `ruff check --fix`. `--fix` deletes unused imports and leaves the blank line that followed them, so the formatter had already run by the time the file needed it and the project shipped unformatted. Swapped; `pre-commit.md` already had the hooks in this order.

### Testcases and harness
- `train/scorecard-plan.md` — planned work, not implemented. Records why the eight static checks stopped discriminating (the opus control arm scored 8/8 on 02-shop), the rejected additions and the measurements that rejected them, `lint-clean` as the one candidate with a demonstrated skill-arm failure, and the unresolved question of how a check that doesn't apply to a case should score.
- Baselines are per-model: output moves to `seedkit-examples/baselines/<model>/<case>/` (`model_slug()` in `agents.sh` — `claude-sonnet-5` → `sonnet`), and `upsert_result()` keys rows on `(case, arm, model)`. An opus or fable control run now lands beside the sonnet one instead of overwriting it.
- New build-phase metrics, both arms: `fixes` (the `FIXES n` tail `fix_report_block()` asks every generation agent for) and `rewrites` (writes to a path already written this run, counted from new `[file:…]` markers). The scorecard reads 8/8 in every scored case and has never failed a check against skill output, so it separates the arms and then stops moving; a fix is a reference file that was wrong, which is what iterating on the skill needs to see.
- Dropped the exit-code column from `results-<cli>.tsv` — `assert_phase_ok()` aborts the sweep on any non-zero phase, so a written row could only ever hold `0`.
- `RESULTS_TSV` is overridable in both harness scripts. `upsert_result()` keys on `(case, arm, model)` and carries no run index, so a variance pass repeating one case would overwrite itself and leave only the last run; repeats now go to a scratch file.

## 26.30.7 — 2026-07-26

### Fixed
- `SKILL.md` §4 — the foundation smoke poll swallowed its own failure. `for … curl -sf … && break; sleep 1; done` exits 0 when the server never comes up, so "if the curl fails, fix the foundation" never fired and a dead foundation passed into §5. Now sets a flag inside the loop and tests it after.
- `deploy-managed.md` — health-check comment pointed at `references/health.md`; the file is `healthcheck.md`.
- `existing-project.md` §2 — derive request handling (`wsgi` / `asgi` / `asgi+channels`) from `INSTALLED_APPS` and the deploy artefacts. SKILL.md §5.7 and `async.md` both branch on it, so an existing channels project used to skip the channel-layer question entirely.
- `tasks-celery.md` — `REDIS_URL` now `.rstrip("/")` like `redis.md` and `realtime.md`; a provider URL with a trailing slash built `redis://host:6379//1`.
- `dev-tools.md` — orbit middleware insert computes the `SecurityMiddleware` index instead of hardcoding 1, matching the silk block.

Full line-by-line audit of the remaining 43 references (previously checked only mechanically) — 36 findings, each adversarially verified:

- Image-build failures: `tailwind.md` called bare `python` in the builder stage, which never puts `/opt/venv/bin` on `PATH` (and duplicated a `collectstatic` RUN `docker.md` already owns); `i18n.md`'s `compilemessages` RUN lacked the production-settings + `DJANGO_DEBUG=True` shim, so it raised `ImproperlyConfigured`; `database.md`'s Litestream entrypoint ran `createcachetable --database cache` unconditionally, but `--database` validates against configured aliases and exits 2 unless §5.3 cache=`sqlite` was chosen; `docker.md`'s `collectstatic` names the single-file settings module alongside the split one.
- `storage-s3.md` keeps `STATIC_ROOT` — base leaves static on Django's local backend, which raises without it. The prose said the opposite.
- `analytics.md` — self-hosted GoatCounter mounted its volume at a path the image doesn't use, so the SQLite DB vanished on container recreate. Volume path fixed and `GOATCOUNTER_DB` set explicitly.
- `error-reporting.md` — `glitchtip-worker` inherited the *app's* `.env.prod` instead of GlitchTip's own DB/Redis/SECRET_KEY; `SENTRY_RELEASE=${GIT_SHA}` in `.env.prod` never resolved, so it moves to a build `ARG` fed by `deploy-github-ssh.md`'s new `build-args`.
- Boot checks that reported success on failure: `rest-bolt.md` and `favicon.md` now test the poll flag and stop the server — the same defect as SKILL.md §4. `rest-bolt.md` also pins `runbolt --port 8001` throughout; it defaults to 8000, so the documented two-server dev workflow couldn't run.
- `realtime.md` — `config/asgi.py` import after `django.setup()` gains `# noqa: E402`; `lint.md` selects the whole `E` ruleset and E402 has no autofix, so CI failed.
- `tasks-django-cron.md` — the `cron` prod service gains `logging: *logging`, which `conventions.md` requires of every service.
- Factual corrections: `django-otp-totp` is not a package (TOTP ships inside `django-otp`); `WHITENOISE_USE_FINDERS` does exist; `django-modern-rest` needs Django 5.0+, not 4.2; `pyjwt` belongs to its `[jwt]` extra, not the `[msgspec]`/`[openapi]` chain; `dmr` *does* belong in `INSTALLED_APPS` when the OpenAPI UI serves static files; `django-bolt` does publish aarch64-linux wheels, so the `linux/amd64` pin is about matching the deploy target; `LocaleMiddleware` resolves URL prefix → cookie → `Accept-Language`.
- Contract and pointer drift: `dbbackup.md` applies to `github-ssh` as well as `vps` and lists the AWS keys in `.env.example`; `deploy-vps.md` now owns `deploy/.env.prod.example` (only `deploy-github-ssh.md` authored it); `healthcheck.md`'s Fly pointer names the `[[services.http_checks]]` block that actually exists; `new-project.md`'s boot check drops `createsuperuser` (SKILL.md §7 owns it); `tailwind.md`'s custom-error-page default aligns to SKILL.md's **no**; `tasks-celery.md` host commands carry the `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` prefix its own prose assumes, and `dev-tasks.md`'s `worker` task follows.
- Smaller: duplicate host-run sections removed from the three `tasks-django-*` references; `security.md` stray URL rendering as a heading; `auth-hardening.md` restated `ACCOUNT_LOGIN_METHODS`; `devcontainer.md` notes the single-settings module; `robots.md` rationale corrected (staging runs `DEBUG=False`, which is why the explicit toggle is needed).

### Changed
- `SKILL.md` — the new-project path is §2 → §8, not §2 → §6; §7 and §8 are both mandatory.
- `SKILL.md` §5.4 — periodic tasks (`django-crontask`) is now an explicit follow-up under the django-tasks options, not something reachable only by reading `tasks-django.md`.
- `SKILL.md` §6.6 — a deploy target other than `none` applies `docker.md` first; with `none`, skip the production image.
- `existing-project.md` §2 — the settings-layout bullet points at the delta rule in `new-project.md`, which existing-project runs never read as preflight.
- `docker.md` — the local-services boot check uses `docker compose up -d --wait`, with the two rules that were living in `train/run-tests.sh`'s build prompt: give every service a `healthcheck:` so `--wait` has something to block on, and don't hand-roll a `docker compose ps --format json` readiness loop (Compose v2.6+ emits NDJSON, so `json.load` raises). Removed from the harness — the skill carries it now.
- `SKILL.md` §5.6 — when the user already named a REST library, skip the `rest.md` comparison and read the leaf reference directly.

### Testcases and harness
- All nine testcases: boot-check poll loops now report their own failure, and every backgrounded process is killed by captured PID. Six loops exited 0 even when the server never came up, and five used `kill $(jobs -p)` — which SKILL.md §4 forbids, because the harness runs the snippet without job control. The suite could not fail on a dead server.
- `testcases/README.md` — the structure template described `## Expected outcome` / `## Run` / `## Check report` / `## Cleanup`; the real cases use `## Prompt` / `## Boot check` / `## Deploy check` / `## Review`. Rewritten against reality, with the boot-check rules above. Dropped the "no automated runner" claim (`train/run-tests.sh` is the runner) and the per-case list of the skill's intentional design decisions.
- `CLAUDE.md` — `agents.sh` dispatches claude/codex/agy, not gemini; the watchdog variable is `TIMEOUT_PER_PHASE` in `run-tests.sh` and `TIMEOUT_PER_CASE` in `run-baseline.sh`.
- Model pins across `train/` and `testcases/README.md` → `claude-opus-5` (were split across 4-7 and 4-8).
- `run-baseline.sh` produced a control arm that wasn't controlled. It wrote into `seedkit-examples/baselines/`, below the `.claude/skills/seedkit` symlink `run-tests.sh` creates, while telling the agent "there is no skill loaded" — and for `agy`, the skill is installed globally. Baselines still publish from `seedkit-examples/baselines/`, but isolation is now enforced rather than asserted: `unlink_skill()` removes the project-scoped symlinks before the run, `assert_skill_unreachable()` walks up from the baseline root and refuses to start if anything is still reachable, and `run-tests.sh` recreates the symlink on its next invocation. Don't run the two scripts concurrently.
- Baseline logs go to `seedkit-examples/logs/baselines/` — inside the wholesale-gitignored `logs/`, outside `review-logs.sh`'s non-recursive glob. `run-tests.sh` no longer mistakes `baselines/` for a generated project or indexes it in the examples README.
- Both arms now run the same `## Boot check` with the same auto-fix instruction, on the same 7200s ceiling. Previously only the skill arm got to iterate until the project booted, which confounded "the skill helps" with "the skill's arm got a fix-until-green loop"; the baseline also ran on half the timeout, so watchdog kills read as the unaided agent doing worse.
- New `train/scorecard.md` — eight arm-neutral static checks (deps, env-driven settings, secret failsafe, DB config, DEBUG default, gitignored secrets, README accuracy, layout) emitting `SCORE n/8`. Both arms are graded on it; the testcase `## Review` stays skill-arm-only because it asserts structure the control was never asked to produce.
- Both arms write one `results-<cli>.tsv` in the examples repo (`case / arm / cli / model / boot_rc / score / build_s / tool_calls / run_at`), so comparing them is `column -t` rather than eyeballing two trees. Split per CLI so a claude skill run can't be compared against a codex baseline — that measures the CLI, not the skill. `upsert_result()` replaces the row for a `(case, arm)` pair, so re-running a case after a skill fix updates its result instead of appending a second row beside the stale one.
- Harness runs no longer inherit the operator's `advisorModel`. Where it is set, the build agent could consult a stronger model on demand — making the recorded `model` a lie for both arms and, in the control arm, supplying the scaffolding guidance the baseline exists to measure the absence of. Every claude invocation now carries `--settings '{"advisorModel":""}'`; `--disallowedTools advisor` does not work, the advisor is not a permission-system tool.
- The build agent can no longer reach earlier generated projects. It works in `seedkit-examples`, a git repo holding every previous output, and nothing stopped it running `git log`/`git show` or reading sibling directories — while the control arm was explicitly forbidden both. Generation phases now pass `--disallowedTools 'Bash(git:*)'` (opt-in, so `review-logs.sh` keeps the git it needs to commit and push), and `run-tests.sh`'s build prompt carries the same stay-in-your-directory constraint the baseline already had.
- Timing in the results table is build-phase only (`build_s`, renamed from `duration_s`). It had measured the whole case, so the skill arm was charged for its `## Review` phase — an extra opus agent run the control arm never performs — and would have read as consistently slower for doing more verification. `tool_calls` was already captured before the verification phases.
- `review-logs.sh` skips `baseline-*.log` and any log with no `BUILD` phase — it was globbing `logs/*.log` and trying to review baseline runs as testcase runs. `agents.sh` emits `[tool:NAME]` markers for claude (codex already did) and `count_tool_calls` totals them — reaching a working project in fewer loops is an outcome the skill gets credit for.
- The harness recorded API cutoffs as failed builds. `cli_dispatch` now appends the CLI's stderr to the case log — session limits, auth failures, and network errors were reported there, where the stdout `jq | tee` pipeline never saw them, so a limited-out run left an empty log that read as a build doing nothing. Two guards act on it: `assert_agent_ran()` aborts when a generation phase made zero tool calls, and `assert_phase_ok()` aborts when any phase exits non-zero. `claude -p` exits 0 whenever the agent completes its turn — a project that won't boot still exits 0 and shows up in the score — so a non-zero exit is only ever the CLI failing. The results column is renamed `boot_rc` → `cli_rc` to stop it claiming otherwise.
- `run-tests.sh` could grade the wrong project. It located each case's output with `find -newer $marker | head -1`, which matched any sibling touched during the case and read find's unordered output; the wrong tree then became the cwd for review and scorecard and the target of the README prepend. The match is now scoped to the case's `NN-` prefix, the same convention `cleanup_testcase` uses. `prepend_prompt_to_readme` strips the prompt blocks it wrote on earlier runs before adding the current one, so a README can't accumulate a stack of them (and repairs one left holding the wrong case's prompt). `acquire_workspace_lock()` in `agents.sh` gives both scripts one `mkdir`-based lock on the shared workspace — the concurrency the mtime match couldn't survive was previously prevented only by a note in `CLAUDE.md`.


### Removed
- `SKILL.md` "Reference files" — the 73-line index of all 50 references. Every §2/§5/§6 question now names its own reference inline (`→ references/lint.md`), so the group listing and the questionnaire no longer drift apart. SKILL.md drops 19,769 → 17,629 chars (~535 fewer tokens per invocation).
- `SKILL.md` "Version pins" pitfall → `conventions.md`, which owns cross-file contracts.
- `SKILL.md` "Snippet integrity" — the settings-delta bullet ("Don't restate values in `local.py` / `production.py` that `base.py` already sets"). `new-project.md` owns the rule and states it in full, naming `MIDDLEWARE` / `INSTALLED_APPS` / `DATABASES` / `EMAIL_BACKEND` / `STORAGES`; the SKILL.md copy had already drifted to a shorter version.

## 26.30.5 — 2026-07-24

### Added
- `email.md` — SPF/DKIM/DMARC deliverability note under the provider `.env.prod` block: a correct `EMAIL_URL` still gets password-reset and verification mail dropped without the domain's DNS auth records. Closes the one gap the EuroPython 2026 "Deploying Web Apps in 2026" 10-step model surfaced against the skill (auth secretly depends on email, email secretly depends on DNS).

## 26.30.2 — 2026-07-21

### Removed
- `skills/seedkit-slim/` — the questionnaire-only slim variant is no longer part of the published skill; the repo now ships a single `/seedkit`. Its last state is preserved on the `slim` branch. Dropped the "Two variants" section from `README.md`.
- `REVIEW.md` and the README "Fable 5 Audited" badge + bullet — every finding from the review is fixed (see the `26.29.6` §1–§5 entries below), so the standalone audit file and its README links are retired.

## 26.29.6 — 2026-07-18

### Added
- Testcases follow the day's reference changes: case 02 opts into `django-browser-reload` (boot-check grep for the injected `__reload__` script + review assertions on dev-gated wiring) and asserts the new gunicorn CMD flags, Caddy `encode`/`request_body`, and the `x-logging` anchor; case 03 asserts Celery time limits; case 04 asserts the channel layer on Redis `/4`; case 07 asserts the new Litestream gunicorn flags and drops its stale `deploy-migrate` expectation (the Litestream exception skips it); case 09 asserts the test-gated deploy (`needs: test`, `workflow_call`), `:sha` tags + `IMAGE_TAG`, prune-on-healthy, and the `makemigrations --check` CI step; README gains the browser-reload dimension.
- `dev-tools.md` gains `django-browser-reload` — browser tab auto-reloads on code / template / static changes under `runserver`; dev-gated app + middleware (appended last, after response-encoding middleware) + `__reload__/` URLs. New §5.1 question, default no.
- `conventions.md` — the cross-file contract (env var names, Redis DB map `/0`–`/5`, prod compose service shape with key order, SameSite rule, Python pins, test settings module). Registered in SKILL.md's reference list with a pitfall rule: when two references disagree, conventions.md wins.

### Changed
- Review §5 drift sweep (REVIEW.md 2026-07-18): `realtime.md` channel layer moves to `/4` per the DB map and its `ws` service conforms to the standard shape (`ghcr.io/{owner}/{project_slug}` image, `env_file: .env.prod`, `service_healthy`, `logging`); GlitchTip's internal Redis moves to `/5` (was colliding with the Celery broker on `/1`); `cors.md` and `gdpr.md` cross-reference the SameSite rule instead of silently contradicting; `auth-hardening.md` pins allauth ≥ 65.0 (matching the settings `auth.md` writes) and drops the 0.5x-era history; `typecheck.md` `pythonVersion` aligns to 3.13; `deploy-github-ssh.md`'s test-workflow note now describes the `config.settings.test` module `pytest.md` actually pins; both REST refs point Docs at the live `bolt.farhana.li` (readthedocs 404s); `redis.md` / task refs' DB comments defer to the map; `tasks-django-db/-rq` worker fragments gain the `logging` line.
- Review §4 missing-pieces sweep (REVIEW.md 2026-07-18): `error-reporting.md` gains a Background workers section — verified against sentry-sdk source that Celery/RQ integrations auto-enable and ERROR-level logs (which `django-tasks` workers emit on task failure, via the built-in `task_finished` receiver) become events, so the fix is documentation + a post-deploy check, not wiring; `gdpr.md` export now strips `password` and internal auth fields from the dump handed to the data subject, and deletion notes the required `stripe.Customer.delete` when billing is wired; `custom-user.md` email variant lowercases email in the manager and adds a `UniqueConstraint(Lower("email"))` backstop; `tasks-django-db.md` schedules `prune_db_task_results --min-age-days 14` (result rows otherwise grow forever — command verified in django-tasks-db source); `tasks-django-rq.md` documents the failed-job registry (`rq info --url "$REDIS_URL/3"`, requeue after fixing); `dbbackup.md` drops `mediabackup` when media is on S3 in favor of bucket versioning; `storage-s3.md` sets `AWS_S3_OBJECT_PARAMETERS` Cache-Control, notes media-bucket versioning, and its VPS deploy script gains the mandatory `--env-file`; `rest.md` states neither REST lib ships auth / rate limiting / pagination enabled — wire all three before a public deploy.
- Review §3 deploy-pipeline sweep (REVIEW.md 2026-07-18): `deploy-github-ssh.md` gates deploys on green tests (a `test` job running `test.yml` via `workflow_call`, `deploy` gets `needs: test`), pushes a `:<sha>` tag alongside `:latest`, parameterizes the compose image as `ghcr.io/${GITHUB_REPOSITORY}:${IMAGE_TAG:-latest}` with the deploy script exporting the commit SHA, and gains a `## Rollback` section (pull + `up -d` a known-good SHA; destructive migrations reversed explicitly); `ci.md` filters `push:` to `[main]` (kills the double PR run), adds the `workflow_call` trigger and a `makemigrations --check --dry-run` step, and drops the false "setup-uv releases are immutable" claim; `dev-tasks.md` deploy tasks in all four runners now carry `--env-file deploy/.env.prod` (required for compose interpolation of `${GITHUB_REPOSITORY}`), and the Makefile `.PHONY` line covers the deploy targets; `pytest.md` omits `.venv/**` from coverage and drops the scaffold-time `fail_under = 80` gate in favor of a set-it-when-real-code-exists note.
- Review §2 vertical-scaling sweep (REVIEW.md 2026-07-18): gunicorn `CMD` gains `--max-requests 1000` + jitter and `--access-logfile -`, with worker count driven by `WEB_CONCURRENCY` (gunicorn reads it natively; without it prod ran **1 sync worker**) — `docker.md`, `async.md` (both CMD variants, `GUNICORN_CMD_ARGS` snippet replaced), `database.md` Litestream entrypoint, `deploy-github-ssh.md` `.env.prod.example`; `redis.md` prod service gains a `redis_data` volume + `--appendonly yes` (queued Celery/RQ jobs survive restarts) and `--maxmemory … volatile-lru` (evicts only TTL'd cache keys, never broker keys); `deploy-vps.md` compose gains an `x-logging` anchor (json-file 10m×3 — unbounded logs fill the VPS disk) applied across all prod service fragments, a Postgres `shared_buffers` tuning pointer, Caddy `encode zstd gzip` + `request_body max_size 10MB` in both Caddyfile variants, `docker image prune -f` after deploy (also in `deploy-github-ssh.md`, prune-on-healthy only), a healthcheck comment tying the localhost probe to `DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS`, and a sentence stating the few-seconds deploy blip; `tasks-celery.md` adds `CELERY_TASK_TIME_LIMIT`/`SOFT_TIME_LIMIT`, a `celery inspect ping` healthcheck on the worker service, and the Beat example path now targets `{app_label}.tasks` (a registered app) instead of the nonexistent `{project_slug}` module.

### Fixed
- Review §1 boot-blocker sweep (REVIEW.md 2026-07-18): `storage-whitenoise.md` replaces its broken Caddy media block (no prefix strip → every `/media/*` 404s) with a cross-reference to the canonical block in `deploy-vps.md`, whose prose now matches the named-volume mount (`media:/srv/media:ro`); `auth-hardening.md` restores the AND-form `AXES_LOCKOUT_PARAMETERS = [['ip_address', 'username']]` (flat list = username-lockout DoS / proxy-IP mass lockout — regression of the 26.27.6 fix), replaces the stale IPWARE pitfall with `django-axes[ipware]` + `AXES_IPWARE_*` settings for the Caddy-in-Docker path, and drops the false "forces 2FA in prod" comment (no such allauth setting); `billing.md` handles `customer.subscription.updated` with status-derived access (`active`/`trialing`) so payment failures revoke access; `csp.md`'s report-only rollout is now a real standalone `CONTENT_SECURITY_POLICY_REPORT_ONLY` dict replacing (not coexisting with) the enforcing setting; `tasks-django-cron.md` imports `from django_tasks import task` (backport, matching the db/rq siblings) and points Docs at the real repo `codingjoe/django-crontask`; `realtime.md` prefixes the dev uvicorn command with `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=config.settings.local` (asgi.py defaults to production) and wraps the WS test around `URLRouter` directly so the injected `scope["user"]` survives connect; `storage-s3.md` quotes `'django-storages[s3]'` (zsh globs brackets); `dev-tasks.md` poe tasks call `python manage.py …` and the `deploy-migrate` table row drops the in-container `uv run`; `rest-bolt.md`'s boot check polls with the PID-recorded `break`/`kill` idiom instead of `sleep 1` + bare curl.

## 26.28.2 — 2026-07-07

### Changed
- `rest-bolt.md` / `docker.md`: django-bolt Docker builds now pin `--platform=linux/amd64` on both stages so uv installs the published `manylinux2014_x86_64` wheel — no `build-essential`, no from-source Rust compile, and the image matches Fly's default amd64 machines. Replaces the old arm64-native compile-from-source guidance.

### Fixed
- `deploy-managed.md`: `fly.toml` example gained a `[[services.http_checks]]` block hitting `/readyz` (so Fly gates rollouts on readiness) and a note to bind the HTTP service to the `web` process (`processes = ["web"]`) when `[processes]` is set — the previous example was single-process with no health check.

## 26.28.1 — 2026-07-06

### Fixed
- `tasks-django-rq.md` / `tasks-django-db.md`: both 0.12.0 adapters are built against the standalone `django-tasks` backport (import `django_tasks`), not Django 6's stdlib `django.tasks` — register `django_tasks`, import `from django_tasks import task`, and use `django_tasks.backends.immediate.ImmediateBackend` as the test eager backend.
- `dev-tools.md`: `lintmigrations` `exclude_apps` used the wrong label `django_tasks_database`; the app label is `django_tasks_db`, so its migrations weren't skipped.
- `SKILL.md`: `startapp` ordering pitfall now also covers packages a settings block references (e.g. `orbit.handlers.OrbitLogHandler`) — `uv add` them before the next `startapp` imports settings.
- `ci.md`: CI `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY` placeholder dropped the `django-insecure-` prefix — that prefix trips `security.W009` at the `check --deploy` step regardless of length.

## 26.27.7 — 2026-07-05

### Added
- `seo.md` — meta/OG tags block for `base.html` + `django.contrib.sitemaps` wiring; defines the `SITEMAP_URL` that `robots.md`'s view already consumed. New §5.5 question (default no, skipped when Frontend = none).
- `favicon.md` — agent-drawn SVG favicon matching the project (initial/motif + theme colors), PNG fallbacks via `rsvg-convert`/`sips` when available (ImageMagick excluded — stock builds can't rasterize SVG `<text>`). Follow-up under Frontend, default yes with Tailwind.
- `email.md` gains an HTML email base template (table layout, inline styles) + `send_test_email` management command; follow-up under the email-backend question, default no. Testcase 05 exercises it end-to-end via Mailpit.
- SKILL.md §8: new-project runs now emit `AGENTS.md` (stack decisions, layout, key commands) plus a one-line `CLAUDE.md` (`@AGENTS.md`) so coding agents pick up project context.

### Fixed
- `ci.md`'s placeholder `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY` is now 50+ chars — the old `test-key` tripped `security.W009` at the workflow's own `check --deploy --fail-level WARNING` step.
- `pytest.md` seeds a smoke test per touched app — a project shipping only empty `startapp` stubs makes `pytest` exit 5 ("no tests collected"), turning CI red on first push. `dev-tasks.md` skips `deploy-migrate` for the SQLite + Litestream deploy (migrate runs in `entrypoint.sh`), so `deploy` is a bare `up -d`.
- Testcase 01 boot check no longer races: `runserver --noreload` + a `curl` poll loop, matching SKILL.md §4 (bare `runserver &` + one immediate `curl` fired before the WSGI listener was up).
- `dev-tools.md` drops the `silk_profile`-inside-a-`@task`-body example — Silk only records within a request-scoped `DataCollector`, so it silently no-ops in a worker; profile from a request-scoped view instead.
- `deploy-github-ssh.md` points the inherited compose `web` image at `ghcr.io/${GITHUB_REPOSITORY}:latest` — the CI-built tag — instead of the scaffold-time `{owner}/{project_slug}` placeholder that shipped a literal `{owner}` and broke `compose pull`.

## 26.27.6 — 2026-07-04

### Fixed
- seedkit-slim wrong correctives (REVIEW.md Part II, verified against installed packages): `django-modern-rest.md` rewritten around the real API — import name `dmr`, no `INSTALLED_APPS` entry, `dmr.routing.Router` + `Controller.as_view()` (the previous `modern_rest` module / `router.register` didn't exist); `django-zeal.md` drops the nonexistent `ZEAL_RAISE_ON_VIOLATION` (raising is `ZEAL_RAISE`'s default); `django-allauth.md` drops the `allauth.mfa.urls` include (auto-mounted at `accounts/2fa/`) and the optional `django.contrib.sites`/`SITE_ID`; `new-project.md` gates `ALLOWED_HOSTS` with `env.NOTSET` and compresses the root-URL section; `django-axes.md` uses the AND-form `[['ip_address', 'username']]` (flat list = username-lockout DoS), notes the allauth `login`-field gap and `[ipware]` behind proxies, drops LLM-known lines.

- REVIEW.md blockers: `email.md` anymail path relaxes the `EMAIL_URL` gate to an unconditional default (prod no longer sets the var — the `env.NOTSET` branch crashed boot); `billing.md` dj-stripe rewritten for 2.9+ (webhook endpoints are admin-created DB rows with UUID URLs — `DJSTRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` and `DJSTRIPE_FOREIGN_KEY_TO_FIELD` dropped, `djstripe_receiver` replaces `WEBHOOK_SIGNALS`, checkout view sets `stripe.api_key` from `djstripe_settings`); `deploy-vps.md` deploy commands carry `--env-file deploy/.env.prod`; `dbbackup.md` cron lines get cwd + compose flags + a real host user + log redirect, restore commands get the same flags, pitfall notes pg_dump client ≥ server major; `i18n.md` installs `gettext` in the builder stage (`msgfmt` missing broke the image build) and on the dev host; `realtime.md` WS test sends an `Origin` header so `AllowedHostsOriginValidator` accepts the handshake; `async.md` pitfall drops the nonexistent `Model.objects.afilter(...)`.
- `typecheck.md` — `reportGeneralTypeIssues` / `reportOptionalMemberAccess` no longer downgraded to warnings (warnings never fail pyright's exit code, so CI passed on type errors). Verified 0 errors at error level across four generated example projects; django-stubs kept over django-types (whose stubs lack `UserChangeForm.Meta` and `django.tasks`).

### Added
- seedkit-slim anti-prior references where LLM priors are verifiably wrong: `dj-stripe.md` (2.9+ DB-row webhook endpoints, `djstripe_receiver`, SDK global not set), `deploy-pitfalls.md` (compose `--env-file`, pg_dump client ≥ server major, json-file log rotation, cron cwd/user/log traps); `csp.md` replaces `django-csp.md` — Django ≥ 6.0 ships CSP in core (`SECURE_CSP`, core middleware, `{{ csp_nonce }}`), don't install django-csp. SKILL.md: asgi modes use `uvicorn_worker.UvicornWorker`; deploy step reads deploy-pitfalls first.

### Changed
- Version refresh (all pins verified current 2026-07-04): base images `bookworm`/3.12 → `trixie`/3.13 across docker / rest-bolt / devcontainer / prose (trixie's `postgresql-client` 17 also fixes the pg_dump mismatch against `postgres:17`); `redis:7` → `redis:8`; Litestream 0.3.13 → 0.5.13 (new asset naming `linux-x86_64`, singular `replica:` config); `uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker` (deprecated) → `uvicorn-worker` package; `checkout@v7`, `setup-uv@v8.2.0` (immutable — pin exact), `build-push-action@v7`, `codecov-action@v7`, `appleboy/ssh-action` SHA-pin placeholder; pre-commit revs bumped + `ruff` hook id → `ruff-check` + "run `pre-commit autoupdate` after writing the config"; DaisyUI downloads pinned to a versioned release URL; Tailwind CLI example 4.3.2; python pins 3.12 → 3.13 (mise, uv examples). New SKILL.md "Version pins" pitfall: resolve current releases at generation time instead of trusting reference pins.
