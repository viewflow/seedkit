# Viewflow Seedkit 🌱

An agent skill to start new Django projects or extend existing ones. One sentence in, a running project out. It wires packages together, splits dev and prod settings, and adds CI.

```
/seedkit SaaS landing + waitlist, GDPR-friendly stack (mail, analytics, error reporting), VPS deploy
```

```
/seedkit add proper auth — magic link, lockout on brute force, optional 2FA
```

```
/seedkit look at our repo and tell us what's worth adding next
```

LLMs write Django from memory. That memory is a year or two old. Think deprecated auth settings and last version's Stripe webhooks. Or database ports open to the local network. seedkit keeps that knowledge in reference files instead. We build the files from package docs. We test them end-to-end and fix every failure. The model types.

What you get:

- **Current APIs, not model memory.** References come from package docs; version pins re-resolve at generation time. Nothing goes stale the way an unmaintained template repo does.
- **Tested output.** Nine end-to-end scenarios: generate, boot, smoke-check, audit by a second LLM ([see the outputs](https://github.com/viewflow/seedkit-examples)). We fix every failure back into the skill.
- **Your exact stack, not a preset.** A cookiecutter hands you its choices, and you spend day one deleting. Here you pick: Celery or RQ, allauth or magic links, VPS or Fly. You get only the code for the options you picked.
- **Works on the project you already have.** `/seedkit add [feature]` wires a new package into an existing repo the same way — something no template can do.
- **Plain Django, no lock-in.** The output is a normal Django project you own. No wrapper library, no runtime dependency on seedkit, nothing extra to upgrade later.
- **100+ hours of AI work, already spent.** The references distill those generate–boot–fix cycles. So scaffolding runs clean on mid-tier Sonnet. Your frontier-model hours go to the code only you can write.

## Install

### Claude Code (plugin)

```sh
/plugin marketplace add viewflow/seedkit
/plugin install seedkit@viewflow
```

### Other agents (Cursor, Codex, OpenCode, Gemini CLI, …)

Via the [skills](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) CLI, which installs into whichever agent dirs it detects:

```sh
npx skills add viewflow/seedkit            # project scope
npx skills add viewflow/seedkit -g         # global (all your projects)
npx skills add viewflow/seedkit -a cursor  # pin to one agent
```

Then, in whatever empty directory you'd like to populate:

```
/seedkit
```

## Project Status

The skill improves with every run. Each failure the test scenarios surface becomes a reference fix, so each release scaffolds better than the last.

Verification runs on Claude Sonnet today. Other models (Opus, Haiku, GPT, Gemini) and the production deploy targets (VPS, Fly, GitHub-SSH) are wired up but less traveled. Hit something odd there — or anywhere — [open an issue](https://github.com/viewflow/seedkit/issues/new): bug reports go straight into the test loop and come out as fixes.

## Contributing

A person reading the output catches what automated tests can't.

- **Hit a bug or something odd?** [Open an issue](https://github.com/viewflow/seedkit/issues/new). Even a one-line "this broke" helps.
- **Run it on another model.** We verify on Claude Sonnet. Point `train/run-tests.sh` at Opus, Haiku, GPT, or Gemini and share the logs; cross-model coverage is what we need most.
- **Read the output before you trust it.** It boots and passes smoke checks, but hasn't seen production. Your review is part of the loop.

For anything bigger, open an issue first so we can talk it through. Full test cycles take a couple hours, so it's worth saving each other the wasted run.
