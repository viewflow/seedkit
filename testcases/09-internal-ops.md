# 09 — Production: GitHub Actions SSH deploy, Bugsink, Umami

Covers the GitHub-Actions-over-SSH deploy path, self-hosted Bugsink for error reporting, Umami analytics, GDPR scaffolding, and CI.

## Prompt

```
/django-seedkit

Project name: 09-ssh-deploy
Purpose: production app deployed to a remote host over SSH from GitHub Actions, using self-hosted services.

Settings layout: split.
Database: PostgreSQL.
Postgres location: Postgres-in-Docker (`db` + `redis` services in `docker-compose.yml`, port `127.0.0.1:5432` published).
Lint with Ruff: yes.
Test runner: pytest + pytest-django.
Type check (pyright + django-stubs): no.
Pre-commit hooks: no.
Internationalisation (i18n): no.
Custom user model: no.
Auth add-on: none.
Structured logging: yes (`structlog`, JSON in prod / pretty in dev, request-scoped `request_id`).
Task runner: mise.
Add-ons:
  - redis
  - tasks: none.
  - analytics: Umami (self-hosted, env-driven website ID and host)
  - email: none (this project does not send transactional mail and the test verifies the skip path).
  - CORS: no.
  - REST API: none.
  - Frontend: none.
  - Auth hardening: N/A (auth = none).
  - Health check endpoints: yes.
  - `robots.txt`: no.
  - `django-extensions`: no.
  - Devcontainer: no.

Production setup:
  - apply Django security settings
  - CSP using Django's built-in CSP support: yes
  - error reporting: Bugsink (self-hosted, sentry-sdk DSN)
  - GDPR: PII scrubbing in error reports, retention defaults, user data export/delete
  - CI: GitHub Actions test workflow
  - deploy: GitHub Actions deploy via SSH (rsync + remote `docker compose pull && up -d`)
  - database backups via `django-dbbackup`: yes (self-managed host — no native backup service)
  - production Dockerfile: multi-stage — uv builder → `python:3.13-slim-trixie` runtime

Run the foundation + boot check locally. Generate `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.prod.yml`, `.github/workflows/test.yml`, `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`. Verify the workflow secret references and run the local release, rollback, and recovery checks below. Do not push images, connect to a real SSH host, or use production credentials.
```

## Boot check

Run the checks in order. Before starting processes or services, wrap the shell blocks in a cleanup script that records child PIDs and resources created by this run and removes them on success or failure. Use a unique Compose project name. For host Postgres, reuse only a database created during this case's foundation step; fail if an unrelated database already has the requested name. Later acceptance subsections run from this project's root.

```sh
set -eu
cd 09-ssh-deploy
docker compose up -d --wait             # db + redis only
uv run manage.py migrate
uv run manage.py runserver --noreload &
RUNSERVER_PID=$!
up=
for i in 1 2 3 4 5; do curl -sf http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/login/ > /dev/null && up=1 && break; sleep 1; done
[ -n "${up:-}" ] || { echo "BOOT CHECK FAILED: runserver never came up"; kill "$RUNSERVER_PID"; exit 1; }
test "$(curl -sf http://127.0.0.1:8000/healthz)" = "ok"
test "$(curl -sf http://127.0.0.1:8000/readyz)" = "ready"
if rg -q 'django-csp' pyproject.toml; then
  echo "SMOKE CHECK FAILED: forbidden configuration or error output" >&2
  exit 1
fi
rg -q 'django.middleware.csp.ContentSecurityPolicyMiddleware' config/settings/production.py
rg -q 'SECURE_CSP' config/settings/production.py
docker build --target prod -t 09-ssh-deploy:test .
kill "$RUNSERVER_PID"
docker compose down -v
docker rmi 09-ssh-deploy:test
```

### Production acceptance

Use a unique Compose project, disposable Postgres and backup storage, and locally built images. Keep the generated production service definitions and healthchecks; override remote image locations and public ports for this local drill. Register cleanup before creating resources.

1. **Secrets stay outside the image.** Create `deploy/.env.prod` containing only a unique fake secret marker before building. Fail rather than overwrite an existing file. Build the final image, then use `docker create` and `docker export` to inspect its filesystem without booting Django. Assert `app/deploy/.env.prod` and other real env files are absent (templates such as `.env.prod.example` may remain). Inspect `docker image save` layer tarballs too: deleting a copied secret in a later layer is insufficient. Remove the fake env file in cleanup. Never use real secrets for this test.
2. **Release and rollback.** Build image A, then image B with a harmless release-marker file changed; tag each immutably. Apply the generated deployment command sequence locally with `IMAGE_TAG=A`, then `B`, then the documented rollback to `A`. Replace only registry pulls with the corresponding local-image availability check; do not contact GitHub or SSH. Require each release to become healthy, verify the running marker each time, and verify a seeded database record survives. Use compatible schemas for this rollback test. If an artifact transfer/update step exists, exercise it against a disposable local deployment directory too.
3. **Backup and restore.** Insert a unique database record and run `dbbackup` with production settings. Restore that backup into a separate empty disposable database using `dbrestore`, then assert the original record and primary key exist. Verify this is a restore, not a connection to the source database. Test media backup/restore too if local media was selected. Backup storage must be local to this drill; no real bucket or production database is allowed.
4. **CI.** Execute the generated test-workflow commands with job/step env, safe placeholders, and disposable service addresses. Require the production check, migration check, and collected tests to exit 0.

Give readiness and restore operations bounded deadlines. On success or failure, remove only resources created by this run. Report local image/Compose/backup results separately; this does not verify GitHub Actions authentication or real SSH transport.

## Review

Read-only audit of the project in the current directory. Quote the file path and the literal substring you read for every claim — do not infer state from training-data priors.

Verify these structural facts:

**Foundation**
- Files present: `pyproject.toml`, `manage.py`, `config/settings/{base,local,production,test}.py`, `Dockerfile` (multi-stage), `docker-compose.yml` (local services only — `db`, `redis`; no `web` / `worker`), `deploy/docker-compose.prod.yml`, `deploy/.env.prod.example`, `mise.toml`, `.github/workflows/{test.yml,deploy.yml}`, `.env`, `.env.example`, `.dockerignore`, `.gitignore`. No `Dockerfile.dev`, no `docker-compose.override.yml`.
- `mise.toml` has `[tasks.deploy-migrate]` and `[tasks.deploy]` (with `depends = ["deploy-migrate"]`) targeting `deploy/docker-compose.prod.yml`, both passing `--env-file deploy/.env.prod`.
- `pyproject.toml` runtime deps include `psycopg[binary]`, `django-dbbackup`, `django-storages[s3]` (or `boto3`), `sentry-sdk`, `structlog`, `django-structlog`, `gunicorn`. **No** `django-csp`. Dev deps include `pytest`, `pytest-django`, `ruff`.
- `pyproject.toml` does NOT list `django-axes`, `django-allauth`, `django-mail-auth`, or anymail/email packages — auth = none, email = none.

**Settings**
- `config/settings/base.py` uses `env.NOTSET` for the prod branch of `SECRET_KEY` and `DATABASES`.
- Security settings (`SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT`, HSTS, `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE`, `CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE`, `CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS`, `SECURE_REDIRECT_EXEMPT = [r"^healthz$", r"^readyz$"]`) live in `production.py` only.
- `django.middleware.csp.ContentSecurityPolicyMiddleware` and `SECURE_CSP` in `production.py` only. `script-src` includes the Umami host (resolved from env at runtime). No `CSP.UNSAFE_INLINE` in `script-src`.
- `INSTALLED_APPS` in `base.py` does NOT contain `axes`, `allauth`. `dbbackup` is added only inside the `if not DEBUG:` block in `production.py`.
- `production.py` `if not DEBUG:` block adds `dbbackup` to `INSTALLED_APPS`, sets `DBBACKUP_STORAGE = "storages.backends.s3boto3.S3Boto3Storage"` and `DBBACKUP_STORAGE_OPTIONS` reading bucket/key/secret from env. `DBBACKUP_BUCKET` listed in `.env.example`.

**Logging + Sentry/Bugsink**
- `structlog` configured in `base.py`. `LOGGING` at module scope. `django_structlog.middlewares.RequestMiddleware` in `MIDDLEWARE` directly after `AuthenticationMiddleware`. `django_structlog` in `INSTALLED_APPS`.
- `sentry_sdk.init(...)` called from `production.py` only with `before_send` PII scrubber, `send_default_pii=False`. DSN read from env.

**Analytics + GDPR**
- Umami snippet in `templates/_analytics.html` (or equivalent), gated on `ANALYTICS_ID` and `ANALYTICS_HOST` from a context processor. Included from `templates/base.html`.
- GDPR scaffolding: `data_export` / `data_delete` views or management commands present.

**Deploy artefacts**
- `deploy/.env.prod.example` ships every var the prod compose references, including `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=config.settings.production`, `DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS=example.com,localhost,127.0.0.1` (localhost+127.0.0.1 for the in-container healthcheck), `DJANGO_BEHIND_PROXY=True`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, `GITHUB_REPOSITORY`.
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` uses `secrets.SSH_HOST`, `secrets.SSH_USER`, `secrets.SSH_KEY`, `secrets.GHCR_TOKEN`. A `test` job runs `./.github/workflows/test.yml` (`uses:`) and the `deploy` job has `needs: test`. `docker/build-push-action` tags both `:latest` and `:${{ github.sha }}`. The SSH script exports `GITHUB_REPOSITORY="${{ github.repository }}"` and `IMAGE_TAG="${{ github.sha }}"` before `compose pull`, and runs `docker image prune -f` only after the health-wait passes. Every `docker compose` invocation passes `--env-file deploy/.env.prod`. `concurrency: group: deploy` set.
- Inherited `deploy/docker-compose.prod.yml` `web` image is `ghcr.io/${GITHUB_REPOSITORY}:${IMAGE_TAG:-latest}`.
- `docker/build-push-action` step has `target: prod` (matching the `prod` stage in `references/docker.md`).
- The container healthcheck in `deploy/docker-compose.prod.yml` uses python urllib (no curl dependency).
- `.github/workflows/test.yml` has a `workflow_call:` trigger (the deploy gate calls it) and runs `check --deploy`, `makemigrations --check --dry-run`, and pytest — no standalone `migrate` step. Env block ships `REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379`, `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY` placeholder, `DJANGO_DEBUG=False`, and dbbackup placeholders (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `DBBACKUP_BUCKET`) so `check --deploy` against `production` settings loads.

**Health**
- `pages/views.py` (or equivalent — `config/views.py` is fine) defines `liveness` / `readiness`; `path('healthz', ...)` and `path('readyz', ...)` in `config/urls.py`.

Report only issues that (i) prevent the scaffold from booting, (ii) violate one of the structural assertions above, or (iii) are an outright security hole. Skip nitpicks. Do not propose refactors, abstractions, retries, defensive checks, or hardening the prompt did not ask for. If unsure, omit it. Do NOT create, generate, or modify any files. Do NOT invoke any skill. Be brief; top issues first; "No issues found." is a valid report.
