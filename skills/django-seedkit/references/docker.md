# Docker

Docs: <https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/integration/docker/> · <https://docs.docker.com/compose/>

Two artefacts:

- **Production `Dockerfile`** — multi-stage. uv builds the venv in a builder stage; the runtime stage copies the venv into a slim Python image with no uv binary. Smaller image, faster cold start, no build toolchain at runtime.
- **`docker-compose.yml`** — the local dev stack: Postgres, Redis, Mailpit when wired. Two layouts for `manage.py`, asked as a foundation question: **on the host** (default — `uv run manage.py runserver`, no `web` service) or **in a `web` container** ("Django in the container" below).

## Image choice

| Tier | Image | Use it for |
|---|---|---|
| **Slim uv builder** *(default)* | `ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:python3.13-trixie-slim` | Builder stage. Handles every wheels-based Django dep (`psycopg[binary]`, `pillow`, `cffi`). |
| **Slim runtime** | `python:3.13-slim-trixie` | Final stage. No uv, no build tools — just the copied venv and the app. |
| **Full uv (escape hatch)** | `ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:python3.13-trixie` + `apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends build-essential libpq-dev` | Use as the builder when a dep has no manylinux wheel (`mysqlclient`, source-built `lxml`, hand-rolled `cffi`). For `django-bolt` pin the build to `linux/amd64` instead — see `references/rest-bolt.md`. |

Skip Alpine (musl breaks manylinux wheels), distroless (no shell blocks debug), and full Debian (slim covers every wheels-based project).

Match the `python3.X` tag to `requires-python` in `pyproject.toml`. `uv sync --frozen` refuses to install on a mismatch.

## .dockerignore

```
.venv/
.git/
__pycache__/
*.pyc
*.sqlite3
**/.env
**/.env.*
!**/.env*.example
.ruff_cache/
.pytest_cache/
.mypy_cache/
staticfiles/
node_modules/
.django_tailwind_cli/
```

`.venv/` is load-bearing — without it, `COPY . .` drags the host venv into the build context and bloats the image.

The env patterns carry `**/` because a bare `.env` matches only the context root. Deploys read `deploy/.env.prod`, and `COPY . .` would bake its credentials into an image layer. The `!` line keeps the committed `*.example` files out of the exclusion.

---

## Local services — docker-compose.yml

Host dev loop (the default): only the services Django talks to over the network. The web process runs on the host via `uv run manage.py runserver`, so the compose file has no `web` service and nothing to bind-mount source into.

```yaml
name: <project-slug>   # matches pyproject.toml [project].name; isolates volumes/networks per project

services:
  db:
    image: postgres:17
    volumes:
      - pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:${POSTGRES_PORT:-5432}:5432"   # host Django reaches it via localhost
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD-SHELL", "pg_isready -U postgres"]
      interval: 5s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 5

volumes:
  pgdata:
```

Key order inside each service follows dclint's expected sequence: `image` → `volumes` → `environment` → `ports` → `command` → `healthcheck` (full list in the dclint `service-keys-order` rule). Apply the same order in every service added to this file.

`.env`: `DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres`.

Add `redis` from `references/redis.md` and `mailpit` from `references/email.md` to the same file when those add-ons land.

For SQLite, skip the compose file entirely — Django writes to `db.sqlite3` next to `manage.py`.

### Django in the container

Apply this only when the user picked the container dev loop. It trades the host's `uv run` for a dev image that matches production's base, and stops publishing the database to the host.

Add a `dev` target to the same `Dockerfile` that carries the production stages:

```dockerfile
FROM ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:python3.13-trixie-slim AS dev

ENV UV_COMPILE_BYTECODE=1 \
    UV_LINK_MODE=copy \
    UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT=/opt/venv \
    PATH="/opt/venv/bin:$PATH"

WORKDIR /app

COPY pyproject.toml uv.lock ./
RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.cache/uv \
    uv sync --frozen --no-install-project

CMD ["python", "manage.py", "runserver", "0.0.0.0:8000"]
```

The venv sits at `/opt/venv`, outside the bind-mounted `/app`, so `uv` never writes a `.venv/` into the source tree to collide with the host's. `--no-install-project` because the source arrives as a bind mount, not a `COPY`. No `--no-dev` — pytest and ruff run in this container too.

Add the `web` service, and delete the `ports:` block from `db`: nothing on the host connects to Postgres any more.

```yaml
  web:
    build:
      context: .
      target: dev
    volumes:
      - .:/app
      - /app/.venv   # anonymous volume masking the host venv — see below
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:${WEB_PORT:-8000}:8000"
    healthcheck:
      # slim carries no curl and no wget; a socket connect proves the listener is up
      test: ["CMD-SHELL", "python -c 'import socket; socket.create_connection((\"localhost\", 8000), 2).close()'"]
      interval: 5s
      timeout: 3s
      retries: 5
    depends_on:
      db:
        condition: service_healthy
```

The bare `- /app/.venv` mount is an anonymous volume that hides the host's `.venv/` behind an empty directory. The bind mount carries the whole project root into the container, `.dockerignore` governs the build context and not mounts, and the host keeps a `.venv/` because `uv add` writes one. Any command that walks the tree then descends into it: `manage.py compilemessages` finds 1226 `.po` files there instead of the project's own, recompiles Django's shipped catalogs for every contrib app, and writes the `.mo` files back onto the host through the mount. The mask costs one line and applies to every such command, not just this one.

`.env` addresses the database by service name: `DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:postgres@db:5432/postgres`. The service needs no `env_file:` — `.env` sits in the bind mount, so `environ.Env.read_env(BASE_DIR / ".env")` reads it at `/app/.env`.

Every command runs through the container, with `python` and not `uv run` (`/opt/venv/bin` is on `PATH`):

```sh
docker compose up -d --wait
docker compose exec web python manage.py migrate
docker compose logs -f web                       # runserver output and tracebacks
uv add <pkg> && docker compose up -d --build web  # host uv writes the lock; the rebuild bakes it in
```

`runserver`'s StatReloader polls, so an edit on the host restarts the server through the bind mount. A new dependency needs the `--build` — the venv lives in the image, not the mount.

An add-on that runs a second long-lived process gets a sibling service on the same `target: dev` build, with its own `command:` and no published port:

```yaml
  worker:
    build:
      context: .
      target: dev
    volumes:
      - .:/app
      - /app/.venv
    command: celery -A config worker -l info
    depends_on:
      db:
        condition: service_healthy
      redis:
        condition: service_healthy
```

The same shape covers `celery -A config beat -l info` and the Tailwind watcher — one service per process, each with the `command:` its own reference gives. Drop `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=…` prefixes from those commands: set it in the service's `environment:` instead (`DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE: config.settings.local`). Do not put it in `.env` — `.env` is read by django-environ inside `base.py`, but Celery's `os.environ.setdefault("DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE", "config.settings.production")` runs first, so the worker would boot on production settings.

Task-runner recipes change with the loop — `references/dev-tasks.md` has the container-loop bodies.

`compilemessages` and `makemessages` need GNU gettext, which the slim image does not carry. When i18n is applied, add it to the `dev` stage (`references/i18n.md`).

### Git worktrees

Every worktree of the repo carries the same pinned `name:`, so a second worktree's `docker compose up` reuses the first one's containers and `pgdata` — silently, with no port error to warn about it. To give a worktree its own stack, set `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME` in its `.env` (gitignored, so already per-worktree) and offset each published port:

```sh
COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=<project-slug>-<branch>
WEB_PORT=8001        # container dev loop — the only port it publishes
POSTGRES_PORT=5433   # host dev loop — also update the port inside DATABASE_URL
```

`COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME` in `.env` overrides the compose file's `name:`, so every `docker compose` command in that worktree targets its own containers, network and volume — no `-p` flag to remember on each invocation, and a `docker compose down -v` there cannot reach the other worktree's data.

In the container dev loop `WEB_PORT` is the whole job: `db` and `redis` publish nothing, and `DATABASE_URL` names the service, so it needs no per-worktree edit. In the host dev loop, offset `POSTGRES_PORT`, `REDIS_PORT` and the Mailpit ports, keep the port inside `DATABASE_URL` equal to `POSTGRES_PORT` (django-environ does not expand `$VAR` inside `.env`), and start the server with `uv run manage.py runserver 8001`.

### Boot check

```sh
docker compose up -d --wait
uv run manage.py migrate      # container loop: docker compose exec web python manage.py migrate
uv run manage.py runserver    # container loop: already serving — docker compose logs -f web
```

`--wait` blocks on the compose-side healthchecks and exits non-zero if a service
never becomes healthy. Without it, `up -d` returns as soon as containers are
*running* and the next command races the service's listener. Give every service
a `healthcheck:` block so `--wait` has something to wait on — that is the whole
mechanism, so a service without one is waited on only for `running`.

Don't poll `docker compose ps --format json` to hand-roll a readiness loop.
Compose v2.6+ emits newline-delimited JSON, not an array, so `json.load` reads
the whole stream and raises — the loop then never exits successfully.

## Production Dockerfile

Multi-stage by default. Builder stage installs deps with uv; runtime stage copies the venv into `python:3.13-slim-trixie`. The runtime image has no `uv` binary — `/opt/venv/bin` is on `PATH` so `python manage.py …` and `gunicorn` run directly.

**Add the production server before building:**

```sh
uv add gunicorn
```

The Dockerfile's `CMD` calls `gunicorn` directly. Without it the image build skips it and the container exits with `gunicorn: not found`.

```dockerfile
# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1
FROM ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:python3.13-trixie-slim AS builder

ENV UV_COMPILE_BYTECODE=1 \
    UV_LINK_MODE=copy \
    UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT=/opt/venv

RUN groupadd --system django && useradd --system --gid django django

WORKDIR /app

USER django

CMD ["gunicorn", "config.wsgi", "--bind", "0.0.0.0:8000", "--max-requests", "1000", "--max-requests-jitter", "100", "--access-logfile", "-"]
```

Worker count comes from `WEB_CONCURRENCY` — gunicorn reads it natively and defaults to **1 worker** without it. Set it in `.env.prod`: `2×cores+1` for sync (WSGI) workers, cores for uvicorn workers (`references/async.md`). `--max-requests` + jitter recycle workers periodically so slow memory leaks don't accumulate on a long-lived box.

Common settings — `UV_COMPILE_BYTECODE=1` (pre-compile `.pyc`), `UV_LINK_MODE=copy` (silence hardlink errors), two-step `uv sync` (deps first, project after), `UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT=/opt/venv`. The cache-mount on `/root/.cache/uv` persists uv's wheel cache across builds — Rust-backed deps without a manylinux/aarch64 wheel compile once and the wheel is reused.

### Waiting for Postgres

No `entrypoint.sh`, no `pg_isready` loop. Compose's `depends_on: condition: service_healthy` (wired on the `db` service in `references/deploy-vps.md`) gates `web` startup until Postgres reports healthy. Migrations run as an explicit one-shot — see `references/deploy-vps.md` and `references/deploy-github-ssh.md`:

```sh
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.prod.yml run --rm web python manage.py migrate
```

`python` not `uv run` — the runtime image has no uv binary, only `/opt/venv/bin/python` on `PATH`. Keeping the container's job to "run gunicorn" makes restarts cheap and avoids re-running migrations on every replica boot.

### Pitfalls

- **Image tag mismatch.** Builder and runtime must share the same `python3.X` tag **and the same Debian suite** (both `trixie`, or both `bookworm`). The Python tag must match `requires-python` — `uv sync --frozen` refuses to install otherwise. A newer-suite builder with an older-suite runtime fails later, at import time, with `GLIBC_x.xx not found` on any compiled wheel.
- **Bookworm runtime against `postgres:17`.** Bookworm's apt only carries the major-15 client, so `pg_dump` aborts on "server version mismatch". Add the PGDG repo in the runtime stage instead of the plain `postgresql-client` line:
  ```dockerfile
  RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
      wget gnupg ca-certificates \
      && install -d /usr/share/postgresql-common/pgdg \
      && wget --quiet -O /usr/share/postgresql-common/pgdg/apt.postgresql.org.asc https://www.postgresql.org/media/keys/ACCC4CF8.asc \
      && echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/postgresql-common/pgdg/apt.postgresql.org.asc] https://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt bookworm-pgdg main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgdg.list \
      && apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends postgresql-client-17 \
      && apt-get purge -y --auto-remove wget gnupg \
      && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
  ```
- **`uv sync` hardlink warnings.** `UV_LINK_MODE=copy` (set in the Dockerfile) silences them.
- **`Ignoring existing virtual environment linked to non-existent Python interpreter`.** A host `.venv` slipped into the image build (missing `.dockerignore` entry). Add `.venv` to `.dockerignore` and `docker build --no-cache`.
