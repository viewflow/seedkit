# Deploy — GitHub Actions via SSH

Docs: <https://docs.github.com/en/actions> · <https://github.com/appleboy/ssh-action>

This pattern is built on top of `references/deploy-vps.md`. Read that first
— this file only adds the GitHub Actions wrapper. In particular, it inherits
`docker-compose.prod.yml`, the Caddy reverse proxy, and the `/healthz`
container healthcheck.

One change to the inherited `docker-compose.prod.yml`: the `web` image line is
built and pushed by CI, and the owner isn't known at scaffold time. Point it at
the exported env vars, not a hardcoded `{owner}/{project_slug}`:

```yaml
    image: ghcr.io/${GITHUB_REPOSITORY}:${IMAGE_TAG:-latest}
```

The deploy workflow exports `IMAGE_TAG` as the commit SHA, so every deploy is
addressable and `## Rollback` below can pin any previous one; manual compose
calls without the var fall back to `:latest`.

## Secrets

Set in repo settings:
- `SSH_HOST`
- `SSH_USER`
- `SSH_KEY`
- `GHCR_TOKEN` — a PAT with `read:packages`, used by the **server** to pull
  private images. `${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}` is only valid inside Actions;
  the VPS needs its own credential.

## deploy/.env.prod.example — ship this in the repo

Lives next to `deploy/docker-compose.prod.yml`. `docker-compose.prod.yml`
references many vars; without a checked-in template the first deploy fails
with cryptic compose errors. Provide every var:

```sh

DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=config.settings.production   # the rqworker / db_worker
                                                    # commands inherit this.

            # Compose reads `${GITHUB_REPOSITORY}` from the shell env, not

            # on every compose call — auto-`.env` discovery only loads
            # `.env`, not `deploy/.env.prod`.
            export GITHUB_REPOSITORY="${{ github.repository }}"
            export IMAGE_TAG="${{ github.sha }}"
            # Server-side docker login for the private ghcr image.
            echo "${{ secrets.GHCR_TOKEN }}" | docker login ghcr.io -u ${{ github.actor }} --password-stdin
            docker compose --env-file deploy/.env.prod -f deploy/docker-compose.prod.yml pull
            docker compose --env-file deploy/.env.prod -f deploy/docker-compose.prod.yml run --rm web python manage.py migrate
            docker compose --env-file deploy/.env.prod -f deploy/docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
            # Wait for the container healthcheck (defined in deploy-vps.md)
            # to flip to "healthy" — don't sleep-and-curl on plain HTTP if
            # SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT is on, that returns 301 and `curl` without
            # `-L` reads success regardless of the upstream actually being up.
            status=starting
            for i in $(seq 1 30); do
              status=$(docker inspect -f '{{.State.Health.Status}}' \
                $(docker compose --env-file deploy/.env.prod -f deploy/docker-compose.prod.yml ps -q web) 2>/dev/null || echo starting)
              [ "$status" = "healthy" ] && break
              sleep 2
            done
            [ "$status" = "healthy" ] || { echo "web never became healthy"; exit 1; }
            # Prune only after a healthy deploy — old :latest layers otherwise
            # accumulate until the disk fills.
            docker image prune -f
```

When this reference is applied together with `references/ci.md`, remove the
`push:` trigger from `test.yml` — the deploy workflow already runs it on every
main push via `workflow_call`, and both triggers firing doubles every CI run.

## Rollback

Every deploy is tagged with its commit SHA, and the deploy script prunes images
only after a healthy deploy — so the previous image is still pullable when a
deploy goes bad:

```sh
ssh user@vps
cd /srv/{project_slug}
export GITHUB_REPOSITORY=owner/repo IMAGE_TAG=<known-good commit sha>
docker compose --env-file deploy/.env.prod -f deploy/docker-compose.prod.yml pull web
docker compose --env-file deploy/.env.prod -f deploy/docker-compose.prod.yml up -d web
```

Migrations are not auto-reversed: rolling back assumes the old code runs against
the current schema, which holds for additive migrations. If the bad deploy
shipped a destructive migration, reverse it explicitly (`manage.py migrate <app>
<previous_migration>`) before `up -d`.

## Test workflow — also pin `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE`

`references/pytest.md` pins `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE = config.settings.test`
in the pytest config — CI inherits it, no test-job override needed. Keep the
`manage.py check --deploy` step against `config.settings.production`
(`references/ci.md`) so regressions in security settings (SSL_REDIRECT
without proxy, missing HSTS, etc.) fail CI rather than first-deploy.
